<h4>Mulholland D&eacute;rive</h4>
<p>site-specific works along the entire length of Mulholland Drive</p>
<p>Los Angeles Road Concerts presents a showing of site-specific projects from over 110 Los Angeles artists in unused public outdoor spaces along the entire length of Mulholland Drive&rsquo;s 21 miles, starting at its east end, at Cahuenga Pass, and resulting with a reception party near the Nike Missile Site in the Santa Monica Mountains. For one day, artists will perform works, display installations, facilitate carpool happenings, host spontaneous readings, and make music in unexpected spaces such as on the sidewalk, between dumpsters, along precipices, as well as inside the audience&rsquo;s cars as they traverse one of LA&rsquo;s most iconic streets. The audience can choose how long they want to spend at each spot, whether or not they want to park or get out of their cars, skip spots or drive at different speeds between them. Audience members are additionally invited to car pool with artists and to switch car pools at their leisure. The road concert can also easily be experienced by bus, bicycle and walking. An official map of the day&rsquo;s events along with project descriptions and other downloadable information will be available to the public starting on December 5 on the event website (www.laroadconcerts.org).</p>
<p>LA Road Concerts seeks to investigate the possibilities of LA's lengthy streets as sites for artistic exploration while using the street itself as a cross-section to observe the city's diversity of landscapes and people, how the Los Angeles metropolis grew, and the massive in-between and negative spaces it left behind as it expanded. How can we generate a new kind of LA experience, utilizing its car culture to find meaning and bring attention to a collection of less obvious destinations? Additionally, through a wide open call process, Los Angeles Road Concerts brings together art school graduates, working artists, local residents, and other artists, writers, musicians, dancers, academics, etc, to realize a broad array of kinds of interactions with the sites. Participants find unlikely audiences, people who may have never been to a gallery space but who ultimately take great interest in participants' work.</p>
<p>A d&eacute;rive is a spontaneous exploration of urban landscapes guided by aesthetic instinct. The Mulholland D&eacute;rive invites its audience to drop their relations, their work and leisure activities, and all their other usual motives for movement and action, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain of Mulholland Drive and the encounters they find there. The iconic Mulholland Drive begins at Cahuenga Pass and winds through LA's quiet, affluent Hollywood Hills neighborhoods, past the homes of famous stars, massive mansions, rich baby boomers in convertibles, people sitting alone in their cars at lookouts, cliffs, crossing over the 405 on the Carmageddon-causing bridge, then turning into "Dirt Mulholland" an undrivable six miles through the Santa Monica Mountains, Los Angeles as a distant backdrop on both sides along much of the drive.</p>
